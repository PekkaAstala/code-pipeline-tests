# AWS Elastic Beanstalk tests
A small project I use for trying out different stuff with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

The source code itself isn't very interesting and is mostly just a clone of the Fuzzy Telegram app that Ali Rizavi created for use with this course: https://www.udemy.com/devops-automation-aws-codepipeline-elastic-beanstalk

TL;DR: If you're looking for something useful or want to see my own code, you're wasting your time here.
